1. Coding 
	- [ ] System routines
	- [x] Implement traverse data structures
2. Algorithms
	- [ ] Big-O
	- [ ] Hashing
	- [ ] Handling obscenely large amounts of data
3. Sorting
	1. At least one O(nlgn) sorting algorithm
		- [x] Merge Sort
		- [x] Quicksort
	2. Common sorting functions
		1. Heapsort - inplace, unstable
		2. Quicksort - inplace, unstable
		3. Merge Sort - not inplace, stable
		4. Insertion Sort - inplace, stable
	3. When are they efficient, when not?

	4. What is the efficiency, complexity in terms of runtime, space used?
		1. To be filled
	
### For later consideration
---------------------------

		- [ ] AVL tree
5. Min/Max Heaps
	1. Application
	2. O() characteristics
	3. - [ ] Implementation (optional)
